Shaheen III
=============

Shaheen III is an HPE Cray EX supercomputer consisting of two partitions: a CPU partition and a GPU-accelerated partition. The CPU partition comprises 4,608 AMD Genoa compute nodes, each offering 192 cores and 384 GB of memory, and delivers 35.6 PFlop/s of sustained HPL performance. The GPU partition includes 2,800 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips and achieved 122.8 PFlop/s of HPL performance. This makes the Shaheen III GPU system the fastest supercomputer in the Middle East at the time of its installation and places it among the world’s top systems, currently ranked 18th on the Top500 list (November 2025).

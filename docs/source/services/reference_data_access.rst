=====================
Reference Data Access
=====================

Access to reference data within the Ibex system requires prior authorization. Users must request access to the specific reference data; otherwise, access will be denied.

**To request access to any of our databases, follow these steps:**

#. Log in to `my.Ibex <https://my.ibex.kaust.edu.sa/v2/references>`_.
#. Navigate to the **Reference** tab, then **Search** for your required reference.
   
   For example, the *NCBI/BLAST* reference can be found `here <https://my.ibex.kaust.edu.sa/v2/reference?id=66>`_.
#. Click **Request Access**. Your request will be automatically approved.

Please allow some time for your access to be activated.

.. note::

   Access to reference data is valid for **6 months**. You will need to renew your access every **6 months**. This helps us track usage statistics and/or cleaning the older references.

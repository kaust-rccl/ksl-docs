Data Management 
================================

Data management is a critical task for KSL users and is a trait of good citizenship on HPC clusters and Supercomputers. HPC compute resources are producers of large amount of data and maintaining the data in storage with its integrity intact is a challenging both technically and financially. 

It is an expectation from the users of KSL computational resources to manage their data by following best practices. This section is aimed at cataloging tools and practices to enable the good data management among our user base.

==============================
Data Science platform
==============================

Welcome to KSL's Data Science platform.
Here you will find the documentation on how to run Data Science and AI workloads on computational resources of KSL systems. The pages listed here walks you through from getting started on KSL systems, preparing your datasets, developing your models, and running the production jobs on multiple GPUs, and everything in between.
The aim of this documentation is not to teach you Data Science by to focus on how to leverage KSL computational resources to increase the productivity in your workflows.

Getting started
================
